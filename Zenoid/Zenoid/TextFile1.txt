  is the offset of the bullet not being drawn correct and collision being faulty???

Things need to add at end
  More weapon types
  Weapon level up system possible
  Player level up system
  Beat boss recieve item (maybe skill point to unlock weapons)
  split story off, maybe fight the good guys and be able to use bad guy ships
